# Rust Language Generic

This egg is designed to run any generic Rust application with Cargo, allowing users to pull their own Rust source code from a GitHub repository.

## Configuration

The server will be stuck as `starting` until the egg Start Configuration is modified. You have to edit the text to match something your bot will print for Pterodactyl panel to detect it as running.

You can use arrays to have multiple different values when different bots are being used

```json
{
  "done":[
    "change this text 1",
    "change this text 2"
  ]
}
